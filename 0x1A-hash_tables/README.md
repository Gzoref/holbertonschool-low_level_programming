### [0. >>> ht = {}](./0-hash_table_create.c)
* Write a function that creates a hash table.


### [1. djb2](./1-djb2.c)
* Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.


### [2. key -> index](./2-key_index.c)
* Write a function that gives you the index of a key.


### [3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'holberton'](./3-hash_table_set.c)
* Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.


### [4. >>> ht['betty']](./4-hash_table_get.c)
* Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.


### [5. >>> print(ht)](./5-hash_table_print.c)
* Write a function that prints a hash table.


### [6. >>> del ht](./6-hash_table_delete.c)
* Write a function that deletes a hash table.


### [7. $ht['Betty'] = 'Holberton'](./100-sorted_hash_table.c)
