# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

---

### [0. Linear search](./0-linear.c)
* Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm


### [1. Binary search](./1-binary.c)
* Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm


### [2. Big O #0](./2-O)
* What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?


### [3. Big O #1](./3-O)
* What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?


### [4. Big O #2](./4-O)
* What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?


### [5. Big O #3](./5-O)
* What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?


### [6. Big O #4](./6-O)
* What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
