# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

* Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.


### [1. memcpy](./1-memcpy.c)
* Write a function that copies memory area.


### [2. strchr](./2-strchr.c)
* Write a function that locates a character in a string.


### [3. strspn](./3-strspn.c)
* Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.


### [4. strpbrk](./4-strpbrk.c)
* Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.


### [5. strstr](./5-strstr.c)
* Write a function that locates a substring.
